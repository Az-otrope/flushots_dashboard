flu_shots_2022_dashboard
==============================

Building a dashboard presenting flu shots distribution for 2022. The datasets used in this project are synthetic healthcare data generated by Synthea. 

Metrics
------------
A. Portion (%) of patients getting flu shots stratified by
- age
- race
- county
- overall
  
B. Running total of flu shots over the year 2022<br>
C. Total number of flu shots given in 2022<br>
D. A list of patients identifying whether they received the flu shots (so we can follow up)

### Requirements
1. Patients must have been recently "Active at our hospital" (have 'encounters' within the last 2 years)
2. Patients must be at least 6 months old to receive the flu shots

Using the project
------------
#### Option 1: Write your own SQL + Tableau (Result files act as a guidance)
1. Load raw data files to a database
2. Run the SQL script in src/queries or write your own.
3. Download the final result table 
4. Use Tableau Public (web authoring) or Desktop version to create the dashboard 

#### Option 2: Create a dashboard Tableau 
1. Use the 'flushots-results.csv' file
2. Use Tableau Public (web authoring) or Desktop version to create the dashboard
